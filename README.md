First, i wanted to say that that i have work the whole weekend trying to have something good to give you. I unfortunately only have the shape of the pie chart and the line chart and i didn't succeed to link the database to the charts. I have immedieatly seen what correspond to the example for the object to code using Material UI. For the database, i have succeed to make some request to see what's the answer were, with a lot of details like reactionmeddrapt for example that were giving the drug adverse data. But, i didn't find how to relate the front and the back. I have been focus on the Task 1, so couldn't do the other part.
